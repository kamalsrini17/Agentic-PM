```

## Step 5: Push to Remote
```bash
# Push the new branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/enhanced-agent-system

# Or with the descriptive name:
git push -u origin feature/orchestration-metrics-evaluation-system
```

## Step 6: Create Pull Request
After pushing, you can create the PR through:

### Option A: GitHub CLI (if installed)
```bash
gh pr create --title "feat: Implement Advanced Agent Orchestration, Metrics Infrastructure, and Optimized Evaluation System" --body-file PR_PREPARATION.md

4. Set reviewers and labels as needed
5. Click "Create pull request"

### Option C: Using Git Provider's CLI
For GitLab:
```bash
